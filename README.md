# Horcrust
Horcrust is a command-line-tool which splits a file into encrypted shards for safekeeping. As long as the specified threshold is met, a user can resurrect their original file at any time - no password necessary.

This project is a Rust implementation of the original [horcrux](https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux) 


## Usage
Horcrust only has 2 commands `split` and `bind`.

### Splitting

```sh
horcrust split classified.txt --shards 4 --threshold 2
```

The split command supports standard input!

```sh
cat ../files/classified.txt | horcrust split --shards 4 --threshold 2
```

You can specify where the shards can be placed using the optional `directory`` argument 

```sh
horcrust split classified.txt --shards 4 --threshold 4 --destination ../../documents/stash
```

### Binding
When you're ready to recover your secret do the following.
```sh
horcrust bind ../secrets
```
